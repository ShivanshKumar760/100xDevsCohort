Morgan is a middleware library for Node.js that is used with the Express framework. It’s designed to log HTTP requests in a format that makes it easy to track and debug interactions with your server.

Here’s a basic overview of what Morgan does and how it’s used:

1. **Logging HTTP Requests**: Morgan provides a variety of logging formats to track requests to your server. You can log details such as the HTTP method, URL, response time, and more.

2. **Customization**: It allows you to customize the log format to suit your needs. You can use predefined formats like 'combined', 'common', 'dev', and 'short', or create your own custom format.

3. **Integration**: Morgan integrates seamlessly with Express. You simply need to add it as middleware in your Express app, and it will automatically log HTTP requests.

Here’s a basic example of how you might use Morgan in an Express app:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const morgan = require('morgan');

const app = express();

// Use morgan with the 'dev' format for logging
app.use(morgan('dev'));

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello, world!');
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server is running on port 3000');
});
```

In this example, `morgan('dev')` is used to log requests in a concise,
colored format suitable for development. For production environments, 
you might use a different format or even log to a file instead of the console.


Sure! To convert the code to use ES modules with `import` instead of CommonJS `require`, you’ll need to update the file to use ES module syntax. Here's how you can rewrite the code using `import` statements:

1. **Ensure your Node.js environment supports ES modules.** This usually means using Node.js version 12 or later and setting `"type": "module"` in your `package.json` file. If you haven't done that yet, add the following to your `package.json`:

    ```json
    {
      "type": "module"
    }
    ```

2. **Convert the code**:

```javascript
import express from 'express';
import morgan from 'morgan';

const app = express();

// Use morgan with the 'dev' format for logging
app.use(morgan('dev'));

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello, world!');
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server is running on port 3000');
});
```

### Explanation

- `import express from 'express';` replaces `const express = require('express');`
- `import morgan from 'morgan';` replaces `const morgan = require('morgan');`

With these changes, your code uses ES module syntax and should work correctly as
long as your environment is properly set up to handle ES modules.
