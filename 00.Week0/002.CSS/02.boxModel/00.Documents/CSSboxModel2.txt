The CSS box model contains the different properties in CSS
----------------------------------------------------------

These are listed below :
-------------------------
>Border(border)
>Margin(margin)
>Padding(padding)
>Content

Now, we are going to determine the properties one by one in detail.

Border Field
----------------
It is a region between the padding-box and the margin. Its proportions are determined by 
the width and height of the boundary ie Screen.

Margin Field
----------------
This segment consists of the area between the boundary of web Screen and the edge of the border.

The proportion of the margin region is equal to the margin-box width and height. 
It is better to separate the product from its neighbor nodes.

Padding Field
------------------

This field requires the padding of the component. 
In essence, this area is the space around the subject area and inside the border-box. 
The height and the width of the padding box decide its proportions.

Content Field
--------------
Material such as text, photographs, or other digital media is included in this area.
It is constrained by the information edge, and its proportions are dictated by the 
width and height of the content enclosure.
