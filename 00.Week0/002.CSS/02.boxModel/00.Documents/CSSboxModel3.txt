Elements of the width and height
Typically, when you assign the width and height of an attribute using the CSS width and height assets, 
it means you just positioned the height and width of the subject areas of that component. 
The additional height and width of the unit box is based on a range of influences.

The specific area that an element box may occupy on a web page is measured as follows-
