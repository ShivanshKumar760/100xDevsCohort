So Now its time to dive into the world of html.HTML stands for 
Hyper Text Markup langauge hmm whats a markup language  

well A markup language is a text-encoding system which 
specifies the structure and formatting of a document and 
potentially the relationship between its parts.
Markup can control the display of a document or enrich 
its content to facilitate automated processing.

So basically a Html is a markup langauge for the web which helps 
in structuring out the webiste its like the skeleton of a website ,basically 
it helps us organise/layout the elements on a website like image ,text etc

there two important jargons while dealing with html and that 
are HTML tags and HTML attributes 


What are HTML tags ?
---------------------------
So html tags are basically keywords reserved by the browser to define and format the web page

HTML tags are like keywords which defines that how web browser will format and display the 
content. With the help of tags, a web browser can distinguish between an HTML content and a 
simple content. HTML tags contain three main parts: opening tag, content and closing tag. 
But some HTML tags are unclosed tags.
When a web browser reads an HTML document, browser reads it from top to bottom and left to 
right. HTML tags are used to create HTML documents and render their properties. Each HTML tags have different properties.

An HTML file must have some essential tags so that web browser can 
differentiate between a simple text and HTML text. You can use as many tags you want as per
your code requirement.

All HTML tags must enclosed within < > these brackets.
Every tag in HTML perform different tasks.
If you have used an open tag <tag>, then you must use a close tag </tag> (except some tags)


Syntax
<tag> content </tag> //this in whole creates a HTML element ie <tag> plus content 


some of the famous html tags are :
1.<head></head>----->contains all the meta data related to website like meta tag and title tag 
2.<title></title>---->title tag goes inside head tag 
3.<body></body>------>this defines the main body of web site and every tag will be nested inside it 

4.<h1></h1>,<h2></h2>,<h3></h3>,<h4></h4>,<h5></h5> and <h6></h6> all are heading tag for website 
heading and each higher number heading tag has low prefrence of order compare to lower number tag
h1 has the highest prefrence 


5.<p></p>---->paragarph tag
6.<img/> tag  is a self closing tag ie it dosent have a opening and closing tag used to insert image 
in a web site

7.<a></a>->annchor tag is used to link another webpage with a content 

8.<button></button> tag 

9.<div></div>->The <div> tag defines a division or a section in an HTML document.The 
<div> tag is used as a container for HTML elements - which is then styled with CSS or
manipulated with JavaScript


10.<main></main>
The <main> tag specifies the main content of a document.
The content inside the <main> element should be unique to the document. 
It should not contain any content that is repeated across documents such as sidebars, 
navigation links, copyright information, site logos, and search forms.

Note: There must not be more than one <main> element in a document. 
The <main> element must NOT be a descendant of an <article>, <aside>, <footer>, <header>, 
or <nav> element.


11.<nav></nav>
The <nav> tag defines a set of navigation links.
Notice that NOT all links of a document should be inside a <nav> element. 
The <nav> element is intended only for major blocks of navigation links.

Browsers, such as screen readers for disabled users, can use this element to 
determine whether to omit the initial rendering of this content.




11.<section></section>->The <section> tag defines a section in a document.

12.<aside></aside>->The <aside> tag defines some content aside from the content it is placed in.
The aside content should be indirectly related to the surrounding content.
Tip: The <aside> content is often placed as a sidebar in a document.
Note: The <aside> element does not render as anything special in a browser. However, you can use CSS to style the <aside> 
element (see example below).



13.<br/>-->br tag is a self closing tag which basically means break line tag ie break the line -->why we need this tag 
so suppose we have a paragarph tag like this <p></p> with a content inside of it <p>This is Intro to web development</p>
now this content will be showed on screen in a single line and if there is a large content it will be shown in the max 
width of browser window to control line breakage we use <br> like <p>This is <br>intro to Web development</p>

This is 
intro to Web development

14.<hr/>->The <hr> tag defines a thematic break in an HTML page (e.g. a shift of topic).
the <hr> element is most often displayed as a horizontal rule that is used to separate content (or define a change) in an HTML page.

15.<span></span>->The <span> tag is an inline container used to mark up a part of a text, or a part of a document.
The <span> tag is easily styled by CSS or manipulated with JavaScript using the class or id attribute.
The <span> tag is much like the <div> element, but <div> is a block-level element and <span> is an inline element.

16.<em></em>->The <em> tag is used to define emphasized text. The content inside is typically displayed in italic.

17.<i></i>->is use to display content in italic form
