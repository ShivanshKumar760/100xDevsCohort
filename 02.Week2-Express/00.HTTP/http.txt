so what is a http and how does it play an important role in backend applications 

So Http stands for Hyper Text Transfer Protocol as u can see its in the name that it is basically a Protocol that is a set of rule to Transfer hyper Text which are basically html
pages ->so we can conculde at a high level that http is a Protocol which binds a set of rule for machine to communicate or specifically for website ie client to communicate with server
ie http allows frontend to communicate with backend


An overview of HTTP
HTTP is a protocol for fetching resources such as HTML documents. It is the foundation of any data exchange on the Web and it is a client-server protocol, 
which means requests are initiated by the recipient(client), usually the Web browser. A complete document is typically constructed from resources such as 
text content, layout instructions, images, videos, scripts, and more.



Web document or client ------------------>sends a request that get this document like html page and styling sheet to render site to backend---->Server
Web document or client<---Sends html page and styling script after receving the request from frontend-----Server


Clients and servers communicate by exchanging individual messages (as opposed to a stream of data). The messages sent by the client are called requests and the messages sent 
by the server as an answer are called responses.

So Http is basically a handshake protocol which means that client sends a request and recives a response from server establishing a handshake


Frontend or the client is what user interact with the  user interface created by using html css js and react is what serves as frontend 
Backend are what the frontend interacts with mere user do not have the authority to interact with backend untill and unless a backend engineer or a engineer is involved in the process 
backend host server and database its written in js,java,python,golang,rust,c or c++
