To install external package we use npm and command is :

    npm i package_name or npm install package_name

after that if there is a package.json file our new external package will be added in that
package.json file under the dependencies name key and if the package.json file is not 
present then it will be created.

lets see a example :
    npm i sillyname
    
{
  "dependencies": {
    "sillyname": "^0.1.0"
  }
}
