The For In Loop-The JavaScript for in statement loops through the properties of an Object:

The for-in loop in JavaScript iterates over the enumerable properties of an object, executing a specified block of code for each property. 
It’s commonly used for iterating through object properties or elements in an array.

Syntax:

for (let i in obj1) {
    // Prints all the keys in
    // obj1 on the console
    console.log(i);
}


for in Loop Important Points
Use the for-in loop to iterate over non-array objects. Even though we can use a for-in loop for an array, it is generally not recommended. Instead, use a for-of loop for looping over an array.
The properties iterated with the for-in loop also include the properties of the objects higher in the Prototype chain.
The order in which properties are iterated may not match the properties that are defined in the object.

for..in Loop in array
------------------------
const array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

// Using for-of loop for array
for (const value in array) {
  console.log(array[value]);
}


Output
1
2
3
4
5


Example 2: For-in loop iterates over the properties of an object and its prototype chain’s properties. 
If we want to display both properties of the “student1” object which belongs to that object only and the prototype chain, then we can perform it by for in loop.


const courses = {

    // Declaring a courses object
    firstCourse: "C++ STL",
    secondCourse: "DSA Self Paced",
    thirdCourse: "CS Core Subjects"
};

// Creating a new empty object with
// prototype set to courses object
const student1 = Object.create(courses);

// Defining student1 properties and methods
student1.id = 123;
student1.firstName = "Prakhar";
student1.showEnrolledCourses = function () {
    console.log(courses);
}

// Iterating over all properties of
// student1 object
for (let prop in student1) {
    console.log(prop + " -> "
        + student1[prop]);
}


Output
id -> 123
firstName -> Prakhar
showEnrolledCourses -> function () {
    console.log(courses);
}
firstCourse -> C++ STL
secondCourse -> DSA Self Paced
thirdCourse -> CS Core Subjects
