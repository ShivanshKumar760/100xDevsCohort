Just like Private Fields we can have private method like this 

#methodName()
{
	//code;

}


the private method can only be accesed within the class

class Method
{
	#privateMethod()
	{
		return "This is a private method call"
	}
}

let obj=new Method();
//we can't access private method outside the class if we try to do 
//so it  will give us error

console.log(obj.#privateMethod());//this will give error

//But we can make a getter property to access it from within the
// class or even a normal instance method will also work


New Program
----------

class Method
{
	#privateMethod()
	{
		return "This is a private method call"
	}


	publicMethod()
	{
		return this.#privateMethod;
	}
}

let obj=new Method();


console.log(obj.publicMethod());

output:
----------
This is a private method call


we can do the same with get accessor property


New Code with get
------------------

class Method
{
	#privateMethod()
	{
		return "This is a private method call"
	}


	get publicMethod()
	{
		return this.#privateMethod;
	}
}

let obj=new Method();


console.log(obj.publicMethod;
